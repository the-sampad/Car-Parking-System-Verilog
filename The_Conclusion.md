# Conclusion
In this project, we developed a car parking system using Verilog code that can detect 
the presence of a vehicle in a parking spot and display the occupancy status of each 
spot on a display. By using ultrasonic sensors and a PmodOLED display, the system 
provides real-time updates on the occupancy status of each parking spot, making it easy 
for drivers to find an available parking spot. The system can be easily customized and 
scaled to meet the specific requirements of different applications, making it a flexible 
and versatile solution for car parking management
