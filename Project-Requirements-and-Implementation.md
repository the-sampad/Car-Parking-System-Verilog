# Project Implementation
The implementation of the project will involve the following steps:
1. Connecting the ultrasonic sensors to the input pins of the FPGA board.
2. Connecting the PmodOLED display to the PMOD port of the board.
3. Developing the Verilog code to detect the presence of a vehicle in each parking 
spot using the ultrasonic sensors and display the occupancy status of each spot 
on the PmodOLED display.
4. Synthesizing and implementing the Verilog code using Xilinx Vivado software.
5. Testing the car parking system to ensure that it works as expected.
